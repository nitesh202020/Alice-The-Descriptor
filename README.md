<h1> Alice The Descriptor </h1>
<p> Alice is an web app which uses Anaylse image tensors to describe the contents of an image. All you need to do is provide Alice with a picture and she will provide you with an appropriate description for your image.</p>

<h3> Motivation Behind the Project</h3>
<p>Tesla Self driving cars — Automatic driving is one of the biggest challenges and if we can properly caption the scene around the car, it will give a boost to the self driving system.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>Virtual Assistance to the blind — We can create a product for the blind which will guide them travelling on the roads without the support of anyone else. We can do this by first converting the scene into text and then the text to voice.</p>
<p>P.S Nvidia research is trying to create such a product.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are everywhere today, but along with viewing the world, if we can also generate relevant captions, then we can raise alarms as soon as there is some malicious activity going on somewhere. This could probably help reduce some crime and/or accidents.</p>
<p>Automatic Captioning can help, make Google Image Search as good as Google Search, as then every image could be first converted into a caption and then search can be performed based on the caption.</p>

<h3> Installation </h3>
<p> Copy the code to your machine </p>
<p> Run the app.py by using <code> python app.py </code> </p>
<p> Open the localhost:5000 </p>
<p> Upload an image </p>
<p> Sit back and Alice will provide you with an interesting image description </p>
